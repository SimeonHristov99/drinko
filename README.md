- [ ] At least 10 properties with suitable domain and range.
  - [X] Functional;
  - [X] Transitive;
  - [X] Inverse.
  - [ ] Make them 10.
- [ ] Examples of reasoning over the knowledge base:
  - [ ] KB |= (c → e)  - at least 1;

## Plan of Attack

- [X] Write down the requirements.
- [X] Write a pitch (pdf file).
