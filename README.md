Ontology about ice cream types developed with Protégé.

This project was made when taking the coarse "Knowledge Representation and Reasoning" at FMI as part of my Masters degree.

## Requirements

- [X] At least 15 concepts (classes):
  - [X] Atomic concepts;
  - [X] Composed concepts (by EXISTS, FILLS, ALL, AND).
- [X] At least 10 properties with suitable domain and range.
  - [X] Functional;
  - [X] Transitive;
  - [X] Inverse;
  - [X] Make them 10.
- [ ] At least 15 individuals (instances).
- [ ] Examples of reasoning over the knowledge base:
  - [ ] KB |= (c → e)  - at least 1;
  - [ ] KB |= (c ⊑ d) - at least 1;
  - [ ] Classification - at least 1.

## Plan of Attack

- [X] Write down the requirements.
- [X] Write a pitch (pdf file).
- [X] Add first version of documentation.
- [X] Add table with classes.
- [X] Add table with object properties.
- [X] Add table with data properties.
- [ ] Fix problem with `isTraditional` data property.
